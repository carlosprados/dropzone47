# Project Quality Review

This review assesses the repository’s current quality across architecture, reliability, security, documentation, and developer experience. It is based on examining the code and configuration in this repo.

## Summary
- Solid single‑file bot that uses `python-telegram-bot` and `yt-dlp` effectively, with clear progress feedback and practical fallbacks (480p, lower bitrate).
- Good ergonomics: .env config, logging via env, friendly filenames, basic persistence, CI that imports and byte‑compiles.
- Main gaps: no tests, single‑file architecture, minimal URL validation/rate limiting, basic persistence model, and limited i18n.

## Strengths
- Clear responsibilities in helpers (format selection, progress hooks, sending files, cleanup).
- Sensible defaults and size/quality fallbacks for Telegram constraints.
- Uses `restrictfilenames` and caps title length in the output template for safer filenames.
- Basic persistence via `shelve` to survive restarts; in‑memory tracking of per‑user download state.
- CI ensures imports succeed and bytecode compilation, preventing obvious breakage.

## Risks / Issues
1) Testing: No unit or integration tests; regressions may slip undetected.
2) Architecture: Single large `main.py` hampers readability, reuse, and testing.
3) Concurrency: Per‑user state stored in dicts; only a single active task per user is supported. Multiple rapid requests may race.
4) Persistence: `shelve` with `writeback=True` is brittle and not great for concurrency or portability.
5) URL/Input validation: Accepts arbitrary URLs; no explicit `noplaylist` or domain checks. Playlists or non‑YouTube sources may behave unexpectedly.
6) Error handling: Some broad `except Exception` blocks hide specifics; recovery paths are limited to bitrate/height fallback.
7) i18n: Messages are English only; no localization support.
8) Dependency/tooling: No linting/type‑checking configured (ruff/flake8, mypy), no pre‑commit hooks.

## Security & Privacy
- Bot token loaded from env (good). Ensure `.env` is never committed (already gitignored).
- Filenames constrained and include video id, reducing collisions; however, validating sanitized titles further (or stripping unexpected Unicode controls) would be safer.
- No rate limiting, abuse protection, or per‑chat quotas; bot may be abused if exposed publicly.
- Downloads arbitrary URLs; consider URL whitelist (e.g., YouTube only) or safe extractor configuration.

## Reliability & UX
- Progress updates with percent, speed, ETA improve UX.
- Fallback to 480p for too‑large video and lower bitrate for audio is thoughtful.
- Cancellation is supported via task state and hook exceptions; works in typical cases.
- If ffmpeg is missing or merge fails, recovery is limited; error messages could offer clearer guidance.

## Documentation & CI
- README is clear on setup, env vars, and bot usage. License present.
- CI imports and compiles; consider adding lint and type‑check steps for earlier feedback.

## Suggestions (Actionable)
1) Structure: Split `main.py` into modules: `bot.py` (handlers), `download.py` (yt‑dlp ops), `models.py` (session/task dataclasses), `utils.py`.
2) Types: Add type hints consistently; enable `mypy --strict` (pragmatically relaxed where needed).
3) Lint/Format: Add `ruff` and `black` (or `ruff format`); wire into CI and pre‑commit.
4) Tests: Add unit tests for helpers (format string, file picking, size fallback decisions) and a lightweight integration test that stubs yt‑dlp.
5) Persistence: Replace `shelve` with a tiny SQLite (via `sqlite3`) or JSON store; avoid `writeback=True`.
6) Concurrency: Make per‑user queueing explicit (one task at a time with a queue) and guard state mutations with asyncio primitives.
7) Validation: Enforce `noplaylist=True` and optionally restrict to YouTube domains; give a friendly error on unsupported URLs.
8) Config: Add envs for `NOPLAYLIST`, default video height fallback order, and bitrate ladder; avoid mutating `os.environ` at runtime for bitrate overrides.
9) Errors: Standardize error messages; surface common fixes (e.g., “Install ffmpeg and ensure it’s on PATH”).
10) i18n: Extract user‑visible strings; provide a simple locale switch or Spanish defaults if the target audience is Spanish‑speaking.

## Quick Wins
- Add `--noplaylist` to all yt‑dlp calls via options.
- Replace `os.environ` mutation for bitrate with passing a parameter to postprocessors when re‑invoking yt‑dlp.
- Add ruff and mypy in CI; they catch many issues fast.
- Explicitly handle >Telegram size files before sending by checking size and messaging user with suggested fixes.

## Overall
Good foundation with thoughtful UX around progress and size limits. The next step is modest refactoring, basic testing, and guardrails around inputs and concurrency to make it production‑friendlier.
